# JakartaEE (Formly known as JavaEE / J2EE)

Welcome to the JakartaEE Modules Repository! This collection represents an exploration of the powerful JakartaEE (
formerly known as JavaEE / J2EE) platform. Jakarta EE is an enterprise-level framework for building scalable and robust
Java-based applications.

The repository contains a set of modules, each dedicated to a specific aspect of enterprise development. Whether you're
delving into web applications, persistence, messaging, or other Jakarta EE technologies, this collection is designed to
provide you with insights, examples, and best practices.<br/><br/>

### Getting Started

Each module in this repository comes with its own set of examples and documentation. To get started, navigate to the
specific module of interest and follow the instructions provided in its README.

Feel free to contribute, share your insights, and collaborate with the Jakarta EE community to enhance these modules and
promote best practices in enterprise Java development.

Happy coding.....! ðŸ˜‰
